# Orbital Mechanics and Magnetic Field Analysis

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation to model the orbital mechanics of a satellite, including the calculation of orbital parameters and position vectors. It also incorporates magnetic field analysis using two methods (`igrfmagm` and `wrldmagm`) to compute the Earth's magnetic field in both ECI and ECEF coordinates.

## Features

- **Orbital Mechanics**: The code models the satellite's orbit with parameters such as inclination, RAAN, argument of perigee, and true anomaly.
- **Position Vectors**: Calculates the satellite's position in 3D space, with the ability to visualize the orbital path in multiple planes (3D, X-Y, X-Z, Y-Z).
- **Coordinate Transformations**: Converts the satellite's position from the ECI (Earth-Centered Inertial) frame to the ECEF (Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed) frame.
- **Magnetic Field Analysis**: Computes the Earth's magnetic field using the `igrfmagm` and `wrldmagm` functions, comparing the results in both ECI and ECEF frames.
- **Visualization**: Provides various plots, including altitude vs time, longitude vs latitude, and magnetic field components over time.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB (R2020a or later recommended)
- Basic understanding of orbital mechanics and magnetic field modeling.
- `igrfmagm` and `wrldmagm` functions from the IGRF and WMM models, respectively.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `orbit_and_magnetic_field_analysis.mlx` file in MATLAB.
3. Run the script to simulate the satellite's orbit and magnetic field data.

The code will produce:
- A 3D plot of the satelliteâ€™s orbit around Earth.
- X-Y, X-Z, and Y-Z plane projections of the orbit.
- Plots of altitude vs time and longitude vs latitude.
- Magnetic field component plots in both ECI and ECEF frames using `igrfmagm` and `wrldmagm`.
- A comparison of the magnetic field results from the two methods.
